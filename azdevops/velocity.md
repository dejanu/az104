# Velocity metrics and usage guidance

```
Development teams around the world share one consistent goal: to release software. A release-based workflow is a set of patterns and policies that focuses on releasing software.
From a planning mindset, being release-centric means that issues are divided into distinct iterations that produce a new version. These iterations are often called sprints and are time-boxed in roughly equal periods to produce incremental changes.
```

* Lead time: measures the total time elapsed from the creation of work items to their completion
* Cycle time: measures the time it takes for your team to complete work items once they begin actively working on them
* Burndown charts: focus on remaining work within a specific time period.


* Cumulative flow diagrams (CFD)
